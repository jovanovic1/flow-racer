Download the latest Mac build from here: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQ0nnzIoefHiRqrPEWWyEfLj3nKkmO3P/view?usp=sharing

If it throws an error while opening the app pls follow these steps:
1. Open Settings
2. Go to Privacy & Security
3. Under Security section on the right, allow app downloads from "App Store and identified developers"

Opening the app now should not be a problem
Cheers
Happy Racing!
